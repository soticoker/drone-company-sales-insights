## Drone Company Sales Insights Project

### Project Details
A data analysis project to help a fictitious drone retail business analyse their sales data and gain insights.   
I created this project because I wanted to improve my Power BI skills and learn DAX(Data Analysis Expressions). 
It's Power BI's formula expression language and is used to do brillant calculations.
