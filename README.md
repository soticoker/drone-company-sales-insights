## Project Details
A data analysis personal project to help a fictitious drone retail business analyse their sales data and gain insights.   
I created this project because I wanted to improve my Power BI skills and learn DAX(Data Analysis Expressions). 
It's Power BI's formula expression language and is used to do brillant calculations.

The Key insights dashboard looks at overall revenue trends, revenue by markets as well as the businesses top five customers and products.
