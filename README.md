## Drone Company Sales Insights Project

### Project Details
A data analysis project to help a fictitious drone retail business analyse their sales data and gain insights.   
I created this project because I wanted to improve my Power BI skills and learn DAX(Data Analysis Expressions). 
It's Power BI's formula expression language and is used to do brillant calculations.

You can view the live dashboard by clicking on this link: [Drone Company Sales Insights Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTQwNTQ4ZTktYWU3Zi00ZTBkLWE1N2YtNTk0MzZlMTJkMmViIiwidCI6Ijc4MDAyOWVmLWI1YWYtNDQzYi05MTNmLWJhNDlmNjJmMDdkMyJ9)
